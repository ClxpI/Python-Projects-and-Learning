# Python-Projects-and-Learning
This repository showcases my journey of learning and applying Python and Processing Python. It contains a range of projects, from foundational learning exercises to more advanced projects demonstrating my skills. The repository is divided into four main sections:

1. **LearningProcessingPython**: A collection of 35 small projects focused on building foundational coding skills with Processing Python.
2. **LearningPython**: Includes 7 projects aimed at learning Python's core functionalities and concepts.
3. **ProjectCritterAnimals**: A larger project that highlights what I've learned in Python.
4. **ProjectsProcessingPython**: A set of 6 creative Processing Python projects showcasing advanced applications.

## Showcase Projects

### ProjectCritterAnimals

This project demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming in Python through a simulation of critters with unique behaviors. Each critter is implemented as a class with specific attributes and actions, creating a dynamic and interactive environment.

#### Key Features:
- **Custom Critters**: 
  - **Examples**: Ant, Bird, Hippo, Stone, Vulture, and Wildcat.
  - Each critter exhibits unique behaviors, movement patterns, and interactions.
  - **Bird**: Moves in distinct patterns, changes appearance based on direction, and reacts uniquely to opponents.
- **Object-Oriented Design**: 
  - Utilizes inheritance to extend functionality for different critter types.
  - Each critter class overrides or extends the base `Critter` class to implement its own behavior.
- **Dynamic Simulation**:
  - Critters interact with their environment and each other.
  - Simulates battles, movement, and other interactions, producing different outcomes based on attributes like health, strength, and behavior.
